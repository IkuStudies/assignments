        Dr. Norman Borlaug was an American agronomist and humanitarian who is widely
        considered to be the father of the Green Revolution. He made significant
        contributions to agricultural science and is credited with saving over a billion
        people from starvation.

        Born on March 25, 1914, in Cresco, Iowa, Borlaug went on to earn his Ph.D.
        in plant pathology and genetics. He later developed high-yielding and
        disease-resistant wheat varieties, which helped increase food production in
        developing countries.

        Throughout his career, Borlaug worked with various international organizations
        to improve agricultural practices and alleviate hunger in impoverished regions.
        He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions
        to world peace through his efforts to combat hunger.
