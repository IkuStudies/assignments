# assignments
a place to put my final projects to look back on and study, since I quickly forget the ins and outs of python

I realized I'm pretty much able to code stuff, with alot of head ache and bashing my head against the wall enough it comes around.  and gets easier the more I do it.

but I decided why not get certified.  many places offer pricey certs but freeCodeCamp offers free certs and its a nice way to touch up on my skills before trying for the official certs

these assignments were not easy for me, it took me all day to just complete 2.  I hope I can get to the level of completing one an hour at this hour.  the more I code the easier it gets.

so here's just a little home for some of my assignments as a backlog.
